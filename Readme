# Sensor Placement Optimization
Reproduction project for ECE289Q – Modeling & Optimization for Computer Engineering (UC Davis).

This repository contains the MATLAB code used to implement:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- POD-based reduced-order modeling
- Gaussian Process spatial covariance modeling
- Weighted Mutual Information computation
- Lazy Greedy sensor selection
- Branch-and-Bound validation
- RMSE-based reconstruction and visualization

## Requirements
- MATLAB (tested on R2023b)
- Statistics & Machine Learning Toolbox

## Setup
Place the following files in the same folder:
- main_code.m (included in repo)
- lab.png (included in repo)
- pixel_coords.mat (included in repo)
- data.txt (download from https://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/labdata.html)

## How to Run
Option 1: Use "Run Section" in MATLAB to execute step-by-step for structured output.  
Option 2: Press "Run" in MATLAB to execute the full pipeline at once.

## Output
The script generates:
- Mutual Information Pareto frontier
- Knee point detection
- RMSE vs. sensor count curves
- Comparison with PV, UN, and RA methods
- Sensor placement visualization on the lab map
